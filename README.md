# slack-jukebox

Instructions

1. Build (applescript-json)[https://github.com/mgax/applescript-json] following its directions
2. Copy the output to `json.scpt` in this directory
3. Build the app

Heavily based off of hawleykc's [current-song-to-slack](https://github.com/hawleykc/current-song-to-slack), originally devised as a way to teach myself a little AppleScript (it didn't come with a license). Uses mgax's [applescript-json](https://github.com/mgax/applescript-json) to make JSON in AppleScript less painful.
